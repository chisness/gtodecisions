Class will start on September 23. \nWeek 1: Thinking in Bets and Expected Value (Monday, September 23)\nThe first step towards better decision making is quantification. This session focuses on converting situations into probabilities, and why insurance plans are just like hands of blackjack.\nProbabilities combined with potential outcomes make expected values. This session is about figuring out the best move, and why sometimes you should make “bad” bets.\nSession 2: Game Theory (Monday, September 30)\nLife isn’t solitaire. There are other players, each with varying beliefs and incentives. This session investigates strategic interactions, and how to make decisions in multi-agent scenarios.\nSession 3: Changing Your Mind (Monday, October 7)\nBeing wrong stinks. Staying wrong is worse. This session explores how to update your beliefs as new information emerges, and become a more flexible––and humble––decision maker.\nSession 4: Risk and Luck (Monday, October 14)\nYou’ve found a good bet. But just how good is it? This session dissects how to estimate edges, determine optimal risk amounts, and how to deal with the ups and downs of variance."

Under Nash equilibrium, no player can gain by unilaterally deviating from their strategy.\nA pure strategy would mean always playing one action, but a mixed strategy is mixing over your possible actions, which is what we see here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNash Equilibrium Strategy for RPS\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Player 1 plays Rock with probability r, Paper with probability p, and Scissors with probability s, we have the following expected value equations for Player 2:\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{R}) = -1p + 1s\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{P}) = 1r - 1s\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{S}) = -1r + 1p\nSince no action dominates, we know that the EV of every strategic action should be equal (since if a certain strategy was best, we’d want to always play that strategy).\nTo solve for r, p, and s, we can start by setting these EVs equal:\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{R}) = \\mathbb{E}(\\text{P})\n-1p + 1s = 1r - 1s\n2s = p + r\nThen setting these equal:\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{R}) = \\mathbb{E}(\\text{S})\n-1p + 1s = -1r + 1p\ns + r = 2p\nAnd finally setting these equal:\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{P}) = \\mathbb{E}(\\text{S})\n1r - 1s = -1r + 1p\n2r = s + p\nNow we have these equations:\n\n\\begin{cases}\n2s = p + r \\\\\ns + r = 2p \\\\\n2r = s + p\n\\end{cases}\n\nWe can rewrite the 1st:\nr = 2s - p\nAnd combine with the 2nd:\ns + (2s - p) = 2p\n3s = 3p\nResulting in:\ns = p\nNow we can go back to the 2nd equation:\ns + r = 2p\nAnd insert s = p:\ns + r = 2s\nAnd arrive at:\nr = s\nWe now see that all are equal:\ns = p = r\nWe also know that they must all sum to 1:\nr + p + s = 1\nSince they’re all equal and sum to 1, we can substitute p and s with r:\n3r = 1\nr = 1/3\nSo all actions are taken with probability 1/3:\nr = p = s = 1/3 \\quad \\blacksquare\n\n\n\nPlaying this strategy means that whatever your opponent does, you will breakeven! For example, think about an opponent that always plays Rock.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{Equilibrium vs. Rock}) &= r*0 + p*1 + s*-1 \\\\\n&= 1/3*0 + 1/3*1 + 1/3*-1 \\\\\n&= 0\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nNash vs. Exploitative\nAlthough we can play the equilibrium strategy and never lose, we also can’t win! If we have a predictable opponent, we’re better off in expectation to try to beat them exploitatively. In practice, you could spend some time trying to figure out what they’re doing and revert to equilibrium if you’re losing.\n\n\nOpponent Modeling\nSuppose you knew your opponent played the following, what are the optimal strategies?\n\n60% rock, 0% paper, 40% scissors\n\nAlways rock: 0.6*0 + 0*-1 + 0.4*1 = 0.4\nAlways paper: 0.6*1 + 0*0 + 0.4*-1 = 0.2\nAlways scissors: 0.6*-1 + 0*1 + 0.4*0 = -0.6\nRock is best!\nThis is a tricky one because paper beats the most common opponent move, but is actually worse than rock!\nNote that we only would use a mixed strategy if the EVs were the same for multiple pure strategies.\n\n20% rock, 20% paper, 60% scissors\n\nAlways rock: 0.2*0 + 0.2*-1 + 0.6*1 = 0.4\nAlways paper: 0.2*1 + 0.2*0 + 0.6*-1 = -0.4\nAlways scissors: 0.2*-1 + 0.2*1 + 0.6*0 = 0\nRock is best again!\nNote that we assume that the opponent plays fixed strategies. If they were able to update, then we’d probably want to be more subtle about our exploitation.\n\n\nData: Talk Paper Scissors\neieio games made a Rock Paper Scissors over voice game in which players call a phone number and get matched up with another player for a 3 game RPS match.\nThey published their 40,000 round data on X:\n Overall: R 37.2%, P 35.4%, S 27.4%\n Round 1: R 39.7%, P 37.6%, S 22.7%\n Round 2: R 34.0%, 33.4%, 32.6%\n Round 3: R 37.2%, 34.7%, 28.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected Value Against TPS Player\n\n\n\nWhat is the best strategy per round against the average TPS player?

    "text": "Soccer Kicker\nConsider the Soccer Penalty Kick game where a Kicker is trying to score a goal and the Goalie is trying to block it.\n\n\n\nKicker/Goalie\nLean Left\nLean Right\n\n\n\n\nKick Left\n0, 0\n+2, -2\n\n\nKick Right\n+1, -1\n0, 0\n\n\n\nThe game setup is zero-sum. If Kicker and Goalie both go in one direction, then it’s assumed that the goal will miss and both get 0 payoffs. If the Kicker plays Kick Right when the Goalie plays Lean Left, then the Kicker is favored and gets a payoff of +1. If the Kicker plays Kick Left when the Goalie plays Lean Right, then the kicker is even more favored, because it’s easier to kick left than right, and gets +2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNash Equilibrium Exercise\n\n\n\nWhich of these, if any, is a Nash equilibrium? You can check by seeing if either player would benefit by changing their action.\n\n\n\nKicker\nGoalie\nEquilibrium or Change?\n\n\n\n\nLeft\nLeft\n\n\n\nLeft\nRight\n\n\n\nRight\nLeft\n\n\n\nRight\nRight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no pure Nash equilibrium solutions because when the actions match, the Kicker will always want to change, and when they don’t match, the Goalie will always want to change.\n\n\n\nKicker\nGoalie\nEquilibrium or Change?\n\n\n\n\nLeft\nLeft\nKicker changes to right\n\n\nLeft\nRight\nGoalie changes to left\n\n\nRight\nLeft\nGoalie changes to right\n\n\nRight\nRight\nKicker changes to left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected Value Exercise\n\n\n\nAssume that they both play Left 50% and Right 50% – what is the expected value of the game?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKicker/Goalie\nLean Left (0.5)\nLean Right (0.5)\n\n\n\n\nKick Left (0.5)\n0, 0\n+2, -2\n\n\nKick Right (0.5)\n+1, -1\n0, 0\n\n\n\nWe apply these probabilities to each of the 4 outcomes:\n\n\n\nKicker/Goalie\nLean Left (0.5)\nLean Right (0.5)\n\n\n\n\nKick Left (0.5)\n0, 0 (0.25)\n+2, -2 (0.25)\n\n\nKick Right (0.5)\n+1, -1 (0.25)\n0, 0 (0.25)\n\n\n\nNow for the Kicker, we have \\mathbb{E} = 0.25*0 + 0.25*2 + 0.25*1 + 0.25*0 = 0.75.\nSince it’s zero-sum, we have \\mathbb{E} = -0.75 for the Goalie.\nNote that, for example, the Kicker playing 50% Left and 50% Right could be interpreted as a single player having these probabilities or a field of players averaging to these probabilities. So out of 100 players, this could mean:\n\n100 players playing 50% Left and 50% Right\n50 players playing 100% Left and 50 players playing 100% Right\n50 players playing 75% Left/25% Right and 50 players playing 25% Left/75% right\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Goalie plays left with probability p and right with probability 1-p, we can find the expected value of the Kicker actions.\n\n\n\nKicker/Goalie\nLean Left (p)\nLean Right (1-p)\n\n\n\n\nKick Left\n0, 0\n+2, -2\n\n\nKick Right\n+1, -1\n0, 0\n\n\n\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{Kick Left}) = 0*p + 2*(1-p) = 2 - 2*p\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{Kick Right}) = 1*p + 0*(1-p) = 1*p\nThe Kicker is going to play the best response to the Goalie’s strategy. The Goalie wants to make the Kicker indifferent to Kick Left and Kick Right because if the Kicker was not going to be indifferent, then he would prefer one of the actions, meaning that action would be superior to the other. Therefore the Kicker will play a mixed strategy in response that will result in a Nash equilibrium where neither player benefits from unilaterally changing strategies. (Note that indifferent does not mean 50% each, but means the expected value is the same for each.)\n\nBy setting the values equal, we get 2 - 2*p = 1*p \\Rightarrow p = \\frac{2}{3} as shown in the plot. This means that 1-p = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}. Therefore the Goalie should play Lean Left \\frac{2}{3} and Lean Right \\frac{1}{3}. The value for the Kicker is \\frac{2}{3}, or (0.67), for both actions, regardless of the Kicker’s mixing strategy.\nNote that the Kicker is worse off now (0.67 now compared to 0.75) than when both players played 50% each action. Why?\nIf the Kicker plays Left with probability q and Right with probability 1-q, then the Goalie’s values are:\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{Lean Left}) = 0*q - 1*(1-q) = -1 + q\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{Lean Right}) = -2*q + 0 = -2*q\nSetting equal,\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n-1 + q &= -2*q \\\\\n-1 &= -3*q  \\\\\n\\frac{1}{3} &= q\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\nTherefore the Kicker should play Left \\frac{1}{3} and Right \\frac{2}{3}, giving a value of -\\frac{2}{3} to the Goalie.\nWe can see this from the game table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKicker/Goalie\nLean Left (\\frac{2}{3})\nLean Right (\\frac{1}{3})\n\n\n\n\nKick Left (\\frac{1}{3})\n0, 0 (\\frac{2}{9})\n+2, -2 (\\frac{1}{9})\n\n\nKick Right (\\frac{2}{3})\n+1, -1 (\\frac{4}{9})\n0, 0 (\\frac{2}{9})\n\n\n\nTherefore the expected payoffs in this game are \\frac{2}{9}*0 + \\frac{1}{9}*2 + \\frac{4}{9}*1 + \\frac{2}{9}*0 = \\frac{6}{9} = 0.67 for the Kicker and -0.67 for the Goalie.\nIn an equilibrium, no player should be able to unilaterally improve by changing their strategy. What if the Kicker switches to always Kick Left?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKicker/Goalie\nLean Left (\\frac{2}{3})\nLean Right (\\frac{1}{3})\n\n\n\n\nKick Left (1)\n0, 0 (\\frac{2}{3})\n+2, -2 (\\frac{1}{3})\n\n\nKick Right (0)\n+1, -1 (0)\n0, 0 (0)\n\n\n\nNow the Kicker’s payoff is still \\frac{1}{3}*2 = 0.67.\nWhen a player makes their opponent indifferent, this means that any action the opponent takes (within the set of equilibrium actions) will result in the same payoff!\nSo if you know your opponent is playing the equilibrium strategy, then you can actually do whatever you want with no penalty with the mixing actions. Sort of.\nThe risk is that the opponent can now deviate from equilibrium and take advantage of your new strategy. For example, if the Goalie caught on and moved to always Lean Left, then expected value is reduced to 0 for both players.\nTo summarize, you can only be penalized for not playing the equilibrium mixing strategy if your opponent plays a non-equilibrium strategy that exploits your strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndifference\n\n\n\nWhy do players make their opponent indifferent?",

    "text": "Indifference in Poker\nWe didn’t get to this in the class. It’s a Kuhn Poker example (see link). It’s the simplest strategic poker game that uses a 3 card deck of cards Q/K/A. Each player starts with 2 chips, antes 1 of them, and then has 1 left for betting.\nWe can apply the indifference principle in computing equilibrium strategies in poker. When you make your opponent indifferent, then you don’t give them any best play.\nLet’s look at one particular situation in Kuhn Poker and work it out by hand. Suppose that you are Player 2 with card Q after a Check from Player 1. (We could equivalently structure this as a river situation in Hold’em where Player 2 has a bluff or a very strong hand and Player 1 has a mid-strength hand.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected Value Exercise\n\n\n\nWhat indifference is Player 2 trying to induce? Compute it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking P1 indifferent between calling and folding with a K\nWe can work out Player 2’s betting strategy by calculating the indifference. Let b be the probability that P2 bets with a Q after P1 checks.\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{P1 Check K then Fold to Bet}) &= 0 \\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{P1 Check K then Call Bet}) &= -1*\\Pr(\\text{P2 has A and Bets}) + 3*\\Pr(\\text{P2 has Q and Bets}) \\\\\n  &= -1*\\frac{1}{2} + 3*\\frac{1}{2}*b \\\\\n  &= -0.5 + 1.5*b\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\nSetting these equal:\n0 = -0.5 + 1.5*b\nb = \\frac{1}{3}\nTherefore in equilibrium, P2 should bet \\frac{1}{3} with Q after P1 checks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium Mixed Strategy Change Exercise\n\n\n\nIf P2 bet \\frac{2}{3} instead of \\frac{1}{3} with Q after P1 checks and P1 is playing an equilibrium strategy, how would P2’s expected value change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wouldn’t! As long as P1 doesn’t modify their equilibrium strategy, then P2 can mix his strategy however he wants and have the same EV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluff:Value Ratio Exercise\n\n\n\nGiven that P2 has bet after P1 checks and is playing the equilibrium strategy, what is the probability that they are bluffing?\n(Note: Including cases where you have an A, so Q bets are bluffs and A bets are value bets.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nP2 has Q and A each \\frac{1}{2} of the time.\nP2 is betting Q \\frac{1}{3} of the time (bluffing).\nP2 is betting A always (value betting).\nTherefore for every 3 times you have Q you will bet once and for every 3 times you have A you will bet 3 times. Out of the 4 bets, 1 of them is a bluff.\n\\Pr(\\text{P2 Bluff after P1 Check}) = \\frac{1}{4}\n\n\n\nNote: If you play an equilibrium strategy, opponents will only get penalized for playing hands outside of the set of hands in the mixed strategy equilibrium (also known as the support, or the set of pure strategies that are played with non-zero probability under the mixed strategy). If opponents are not playing equilibrium, though, then they open themselves up to exploitation.",

    "text": "Expected Value Examples\nWe went through a few basic expected value examples to get the hang of it.\n\nRain and Umbrellas\nHow much would you pay to have an umbrella if it was raining and you didn’t already have one?\nHow much would you pay to not have to carry an umbrella if there was no rain and you were already carrying one?\nThese are the answers from the class:\n\n\n\nRain and No Umbrella\nNo Rain and Carrying Umbrella\n\n\n\n\n$10\n$0\n\n\n$20\n$1\n\n\n$5\n$2\n\n\n$5\n$1\n\n\n$7\n$3\n\n\n$10\n$10\n\n\n$10\n$5\n\n\n$20\n$5\n\n\n$3\n$3\n\n\n$25\n$10\n\n\n\nRain and No Umbrella average: $115/10 = $11.50\nNo Rain and Umbrella average: $40/10 = $4.00\nFrom here we ask what is the breakeven percentage chance of rain that this average person should choose to carry vs. not carry an umbrella?\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n11.5*P(\\text{rain}) &= 4*P(\\text{no rain}) && \\Rightarrow \\text{Let } P(\\text{rain}) = p \\\\\n11.5*p &= 4*(1-p) \\\\\n11.5*p &= 4 - 4*p \\\\\n15.5*p &= 4 \\\\\np &= .258 \\\\\n&= 25.8\\%\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\nTherefore if it’s more than 25.8% probable to rain, this person should take an umbrella, and if less then 25.8% then they should leave it at home.\n\n\nPoker\nNext we looked at this poker hand:\n\nWhat is the probability of winning the hand as the player with the 3♥4♥?\nWe see 8 total cards (our 2, opponent 2, and board 4). We need a heart of which there are 13 in the deck, but 4 already out (2 in our hand, 2 on the board).\nTherefore the odds of hitting our heart are 9/44 = 0.2 (rounding).\nAssume that the pot is currently $120.\nWhat all-in bet from our opponent can we profitably call?\nWe know that a tiny bet of $1 will definitely give us the correct odds of calling. We know that a huge bet of $10,000 will definitely not give us the correct odds of calling.\nWe can calculate this mathematically. Let b be the opponent’s bet size that we have to call.\nTotal pot if we call = 120 + b + b.\nOur equity of this pot is 0.2.\nTherefore we breakeven when:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\nb &= 0.2*(120 + 2b) \\\\\nb &= 24 + 0.4b \\\\\n0.6b &= 24 \\\\\nb &= 40\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\nTherefore when the bet size is 40 we are indifferent to calling and folding. When it’s more than 40, we don’t have sufficient odds to call and should fold. When it’s less than 40, we have profitable odds to call and should call.\nNote that we make the call even when we are unlikely to win! This is because we’re making the decision based on the probabilities.\n\n\nBasketball Shots\nFor the final example, we looked a shooting a 2-pointer vs. 3-pointer in basketball.\nIf we assume that a 2-pointer is 60% to make and a 3-pointer is 33% to make, then we have a relatively simple decision early in the game.\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{2-pointer}) = 0.6*2 = 1.2\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{3-pointer}) = 0.33*3 = 1\nTherefore we should take the 2-pointer. But let’s look at an end of game scenario where our team is down by 2 points and deciding on their final shot. Making a 2-pointer will go to overtime, while making a 3-pointer will instantly win.\n\nWe work out that now:\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{2-pointer win}) = 0.6*0.5 = 0.3\n\\mathbb{E}(\\text{3-pointer win}) = 0.33\nUnder this scenario, we see that it makes sense to go for the 3-pointer even though the immediate odds of the 3-pointer are lower as we showed at the beginning of this section.",

    "text": "Group Discussion\nWe talked about how these EV examples are relatively straightforward, but there are many factors that are not always easily quantifiable. There are also cases where our preferences (utility functions) are not aligned with the $EV. For example, if offered a coinflip for $100m vs. a free $40m, you’d probably need to be very rich or very risk-seeking to prefer the flip.\nOther examples:\n\nInsurance\nLoss aversion (losing $1000 worse than winning $1000)\nValue of time\nOpportunity cost\nSomething that’s -EV now but can open up a +EV opportunity later\nMoral issues\nStress avoidance\n\nWe split into groups where teams made up example scenarios that were less straightforward.\n\nRobbing a Bank\nWhat if you need to rob a bank to pay for your dog’s surgery? You might be thinking “There are probably better options”. But let’s check the EV just to be sure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see that with 30% probability you immediately go to jail, which is worth -$100k.\nWith 70% probability, you successfully rob the bank for $10k.\nBut then once you successfully rob the bank, apparently the strategy is to rob another one. This works 80% of the time for another $10k. And if it fails, your loss is -$125k (only marginally worse than getting caught the first time). (Note that the tree diagram shows -$25k, but meant this in addition to the original possible loss.)\nFinally, if you succeded twice, you give it one last try, but this time is only 50% successful for another $10k and risks loss of -$133k.\nSo what’s the EV?\n0.7*0.8*0.5 = 0.28 you will get 30k, for an EV of 30*.28 = 8.4\n0.3 you go to jail (value -100k) for an EV of -100*.3 = -30\n0.14 you go to jail (value -125k) for an EV of -125*.14 = -17.5\n0.28 you go to jail (value -133k) for an EV of -133*.28 = -37.4\nThere is a 28% of success and 72% of ending up in jail. If you do succeed, you’ll end up with $30k.\nWe can sum all of the individual expected values and get total EV:\n-84.9 + 8.4 = -76.5\nWhatever the EV calculations, don’t rob a bank.\n\n\nTurning Back on Everest\n\n\n\nPicking a Job",
